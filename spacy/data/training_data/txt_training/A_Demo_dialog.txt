Dr. Martinez (GP): Good morning! It’s great to see you again, Jordan. I see from your file you just turned 29—happy belated birthday!

Jordan Kim (Patient): Thanks, Dr. Martinez! Yeah, 29 last week. I feel it in my knees already. [laughs]

Dr. Martinez: [smiles] Well, you’ve been coming here since you were 22, and you’ve always been active. I remember when you first mentioned training for your first half-marathon in Prospect Park—how’s the running been lately?

Jordan Kim: Not great, to be honest. I’ve had this pain around my right kneecap for a few weeks now. It gets worse after I run, especially if I’ve been going uphill. It’s starting to affect my job, too—walking around campus all day as a TA is becoming painful.

Dr. Martinez: That sounds frustrating. So it’s your right knee, and this has been going on for a few weeks. Does it hurt when you’re sitting for long periods too, like during your seminars at Columbia?

Jordan Kim: Exactly, yes. If I’m sitting in Butler Library grading papers for an hour or two, my knee starts aching when I stand up. Sometimes even just going up the subway stairs at 116th Street is rough.

Dr. Martinez: Got it. And I see here from your last visit that you increased your mileage pretty significantly around the time you were prepping for that Brooklyn 10K, right?

Jordan Kim: Yeah, I went from about 15 miles a week to close to 30. Probably too quickly, I guess.

Dr. Martinez: That’s a common trigger. Runner’s knee, or patellofemoral pain syndrome, can flare up when the muscles around the kneecap aren’t keeping it aligned properly—especially with a rapid increase in mileage or hill work. You’ve always had a bit of pronation in your stride, too, which could be contributing.

Jordan Kim: I’ve been using the same Asics for almost a year—maybe they’re worn out?

Dr. Martinez: Possibly. I can refer you to a gait analysis specialist, or you can check in again with that physical therapist you saw last year—Maya Patel, right? She’s at Motion Recovery on 82nd Street?

Jordan Kim: Yeah, I liked Maya. She really helped when I had that Achilles thing in 2023.

Dr. Martinez: Perfect. I’ll send her your updated notes. In the meantime, let’s reduce your mileage, especially on hills, and do some strengthening exercises for your quads and hips. Ice after activity, and maybe consider a knee brace when you're walking around campus.

Jordan Kim: Okay, sounds doable. I’ve got a trip to visit my sister in Seattle in two weeks—do you think I’ll be able to hike?

Dr. Martinez: If you stick to the plan, light hiking with proper footwear should be fine. Just don’t try to summit Mount Rainier. [chuckles]

Jordan Kim: No promises.
